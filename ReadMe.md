This was a game created based on the classic game called Oregon Trail. My partner Devin Gessner and I created it and it can all be played in the terminal.

How to Run:
Step 1: Make sure you have the g++ compiler in the terminal
Step 2: Run the command " g++ trail.cpp mainplayer.cpp shop.cpp supplies.cpp certificate.cpp"
Step 3: Run the command "./a.out"
